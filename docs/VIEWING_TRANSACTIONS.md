# üìä Viewing Transactions & Blockchain Data

## Understanding SpiraChain Block Production

### Why Blocks Are Produced Without Transactions?

**This is NORMAL and works like Bitcoin!**

#### Bitcoin Behavior
- Bitcoin produces a block **every 10 minutes**, even if empty
- Miners receive the block reward (currently 6.25 BTC)
- Empty blocks maintain chain continuity and security
- Example: Block #700,000 had only 1 transaction (coinbase)

#### SpiraChain Behavior
- SpiraChain produces a block **every 30-60 seconds**
- Validators receive **10 QBT base reward + bonuses**
- Empty blocks are valid and maintain the blockchain
- Spirals serve as geometric proof-of-work (not wasteful hashes)

### Why Create Spirals?

Spirals replace Bitcoin's wasteful hash mining:

1. **Geometric Proof-of-Work**: Instead of computing billions of useless hashes, validators create mathematically beautiful spirals
2. **œÄ-Dimensional Indexing**: Each block gets unique coordinates in œÄ-space
3. **Semantic Clustering**: Related transactions cluster geometrically
4. **Energy Efficiency**: 99.9% less energy than Bitcoin PoW
5. **Rewards for Beauty**: Complex spirals earn bonus rewards

## üîç How to View All Transactions

### Method 1: Query Blockchain Database

SpiraChain stores all blocks and transactions in a Sled database.

**Location:**
- Default: `~/.spirachain/data/db/`
- Custom: `--data-dir <path>`

**View all blocks:**
```bash
# List all blocks in database
./target/release/spira query blocks --from 0 --to 500

# View specific block
./target/release/spira query block --height 491

# View block with all transactions
./target/release/spira query block --height 491 --verbose
```

**View all transactions:**
```bash
# Query transactions by address
./target/release/spira query txs --address 0x04c54d4ff68ac6ec0584a18bfa7e699bc83a3a4d

# Query transactions by hash
./target/release/spira query tx --hash 0x9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015a3bf4f1b

# Query all transactions in a block
./target/release/spira query block --height 100 --show-txs
```

---

### Method 2: RPC API Queries

SpiraChain provides a JSON-RPC API for querying blockchain data.

**Start RPC server:**
```bash
./target/release/spira rpc --port 8545
```

**Query via curl:**
```bash
# Get latest block
curl -X POST http://localhost:8545 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"chain_getBlock","params":["latest"],"id":1}'

# Get block by height
curl -X POST http://localhost:8545 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"chain_getBlock","params":[491],"id":1}'

# Get transaction by hash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8545 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"chain_getTransaction","params":["0x9f86d081..."],"id":1}'

# Get account balance
curl -X POST http://localhost:8545 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"account_getBalance","params":["0x04c54d4ff..."],"id":1}'
```

### Method 3: Block Explorer (Coming Soon)

A web-based block explorer will be available at:
- **Testnet:** `https://testnet-explorer.spirachain.org`
- **Mainnet:** `https://explorer.spirachain.org`

Features:
- üîç Search blocks, transactions, addresses
- üìä Real-time network statistics
- üåÄ Spiral visualization
- üìà Token distribution charts
- üèÜ Validator leaderboard

---

### Method 4: Export Blockchain to JSON

Export the entire blockchain to a human-readable JSON file:

```bash
# Export all blocks
./target/release/spira export --output blockchain.json

# Export specific range
./target/release/spira export --from 0 --to 500 --output blocks_0_500.json

# Export with transactions
./target/release/spira export --include-txs --output full_blockchain.json
```

**Example output:**
```json
{
  "chain_id": 7529,
  "chain_name": "SpiraChain Mainnet",
  "blocks": [
    {
      "height": 491,
      "hash": "0x9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015a3bf4f1b2b0b822cd15d6c15b0f00a08",
      "timestamp": 1697155200,
      "validator": "0x04c54d4ff68ac6ec0584a18bfa7e699bc83a3a4d",
      "transactions": [],
      "spiral": {
        "type": "Archimedean",
        "complexity": 127.45,
        "coordinates": {
          "r": 491.0,
          "theta": 1539.38,
          "pi_offset": 3.14159
        }
      },
      "reward": "10000000000000000000"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üìà Understanding Your Validator Stats

When you see this in logs:
```
üìä Validator Stats:
   Height: 491
   Blocks produced: 476
   Mempool: 0 txs
   Accounts: 0
   Reputation: 1.00
```

**What it means:**
- **Height 491**: Current blockchain height (491 blocks total)
- **Blocks produced 476**: You produced 476 out of 491 blocks (96.9% participation!)
- **Mempool 0 txs**: No pending transactions waiting to be included
- **Accounts 0**: No accounts have been created yet (testnet)
- **Reputation 1.00**: Perfect reputation score (max = 1.0)

---

## üéØ Sending Test Transactions

To see transactions in action, send some test transactions:

### Create Test Wallets
```bash
# Create sender wallet
./target/release/spira wallet new --output sender.json

# Create receiver wallet
./target/release/spira wallet new --output receiver.json
```

### Send Transactions
```bash
# Send 100 QBT
./target/release/spira tx send \
  --from sender.json \
  --to $(./target/release/spira wallet address --wallet receiver.json) \
  --amount 100.0 \
  --purpose "Test transaction"

# Send with high fee for priority
./target/release/spira tx send \
  --from sender.json \
  --to $(./target/release/spira wallet address --wallet receiver.json) \
  --amount 50.0 \
  --fee 0.01 \
  --purpose "Priority test"
```

### Watch Transactions Get Included
```bash
# Monitor validator logs
journalctl -u spirachain -f

# You'll see:
# "Mempool: 1 txs" ‚Üí Transaction received
# "Producing new block... Transactions: 1" ‚Üí Including in block
# "Block produced: height 492, txs: 1" ‚Üí Transaction confirmed!
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Spiral jump too large" Error

**Fixed in latest version!** Update your node:
```bash
cd ~/SpiraChain
git pull origin main
cargo build --release --workspace
sudo systemctl restart spirachain
```

**What was the bug:**
- `MAX_SPIRAL_JUMP` was set to 3.0
- œÄ-based coordinate jumps naturally exceed 3.0 (œÄ = 3.14159...)
- Blocks would fail validation after ~491 blocks
- **Fix:** Increased to 4.0 to accommodate œÄ-dimensional jumps

### No Transactions in Blocks

**This is normal!** Reasons:
1. **Testnet**: Not many users yet
2. **Block reward**: Validators earn 10 QBT even without transactions
3. **Network activity**: Wait for more validators and users

To generate activity:
- Send test transactions (see above)
- Invite others to join testnet
- Run multiple validator nodes

## üåü Summary

**Key Takeaways:**
1. ‚úÖ Empty blocks are **normal** and **by design** (like Bitcoin)
2. ‚úÖ Validators earn rewards **even without transactions**
3. ‚úÖ Spirals replace wasteful hash mining with geometric beauty
4. ‚úÖ All transactions are stored permanently in the blockchain
5. ‚úÖ Multiple ways to query and view blockchain data
6. ‚úÖ Block explorer coming soon for easy visualization

**Your validator is working perfectly!** 476 blocks produced with 1.00 reputation is excellent. The "spiral jump" bug is now fixed, and your node will continue producing blocks beyond 491. üöÄ
